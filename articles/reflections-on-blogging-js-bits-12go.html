          <p>At the midway point of this year, I decided to pick up blogging as a new quarantine hobby. I stuck with it, writing a post every week since the beginning of July on a random JavaScript topic for my blog <a href="http://jsbits-yo.com/">JS Bits</a>. üéâ</p>

<p>Here are some of things I learned along the way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blogging is an awesome way to learn. When you actually write for other people, it really forces you to know your stuff. This extra consideration is great motivation.</li>
<li>dev.to has an awesome <a href="https://docs.dev.to/api/">API</a>. At first, I was copying and pasting articles between dev.to and my website. But with this API you can simply just fetch the article from your site and load it dynamically.</li>
<li>It's super interesting which kind of articles get the most engagement. Here are my top 5 posts this year: 

<ul>
<li>1,461 views: <a href="https://dev.to/js_bits_bill/how-svgs-can-be-dangerous-js-bits-mjh">How SVGs can be dangerous</a>
</li>
<li>1,374 views: <a href="https://dev.to/js_bits_bill/addeventlistener-once-js-bits-565d">addEventListener "once"</a>
</li>
<li>940 views: <a href="https://dev.to/js_bits_bill/symbols-are-your-friend-a-gentle-introduction-js-bits-23af">Symbols Are Your Friend Part I: A Gentle Introduction</a>
</li>
<li>312 views: <a href="https://dev.to/js_bits_bill/cleartimeout-and-clearinterval-are-interchangeable-30bg">clearTimeout and clearInterval Are Interchangeable!</a>
</li>
<li>230 views: <a href="https://dev.to/js_bits_bill/symbols-are-your-friend-part-iii-symbol-iterator-js-bits-18c4">Symbols Are Your Friend Part III: Symbol.iterator</a>
</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>Just writing once a week can feel like a chore after a while. I'm in awe of those who can keep it up regularly. </li>
<li>Despite this, I never felt there was a lack of topics, even excluding JS frameworks and libraries. There's so much to learn about even just the base language and I truly believe this is the best way to grow stronger as a dev.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what's the plan for the future? Well, I think I'll continue blogging at my own pace - whenever an interesting topic crosses my mind. üôÇ I also plan on learning more about the latest VueJS updates as well as finding opportunities for mentoring. </p>

<p>Thanks everyone for reading and Happy New Year! üçæ</p>

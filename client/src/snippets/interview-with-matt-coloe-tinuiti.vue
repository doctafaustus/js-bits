    <p>
      An interview with Matthew Coloe, developer @ Tinuiti. Matt is my brother and made a career transition to front-end development several years ago when I introduced him to a former company of mine. He's self-taught and is a life-long learner of technology. We talk work/life balance, development challenges, and we do a random lightning round just for fun!

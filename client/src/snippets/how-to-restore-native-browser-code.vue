    <p>
      Native code is functionality that has been included by the browser's engine and not defined by you, the programmer. Some browsers like Chrome allow you to see if a function is native by simply entering it in the console (and not calling it with parentheses):

    <p>
      Occassionally, you may encounter a scenario where some native code has been overwritten. In my experience as a 3rd party dev, I've seen a few instances where the console has been overwritten to an empty function. This is usually done by clients  who are hyper-cautious about sensitive customer information being shown (<i>but seriously, if someone really wants to find this info they will!</i>). Trying to write code without a functioning console is a giant pain so I had a good use case to restore the console's native functionality. (Note this was only done for local development and not deployed live!).
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the <a href="https://m.kohls.com/" target="_blank">Khols.com</a> mobile site has all their console methods overwritten to an empty function.

    <p>So here's how we can restore it:</p>

    <pre v-highlightjs><code class="javascript">
      function createConsoleProxy() {

        // Create dummy iframe to steal its fresh console object
        const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');

        // Add iframe to current window's scope in a hidden state
        iframe.id = 'console-proxy';
        iframe.style.display = 'none';
        document.body.insertAdjacentElement('beforeend', iframe);

        // Reassign value of console to iframe's console 
        const proxyIframe = document.querySelector('#console-proxy');
        window.console = proxyIframe.contentWindow.console;
      }
    </code></pre>

    <p>When we enter <code>console.log;</code> in the console... BAM! It's back to it's "native" state!</p>

    <p>Before this method was used, a coworker came up with a clever alternative to view messages by creating a custom <code>log()</code> function that would take user input and prepend it to the body:</p>

    <pre v-highlightjs><code class="javascript">
      function log(msg) {
        const body = document.body;
        body.insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin', `&lt;div&gt;${msg}&lt;div&gt;`);
      }
    </code></pre>

    <p>This worked enough to see simple messages but we quickly realized we needed the ability to expand objects so it had limited use. But challenges like this are always fun. ðŸ¤ª</p>
